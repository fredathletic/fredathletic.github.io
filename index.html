                <p>Freddie Ljungberg didn’t always dream of being a coach. “No it wasn’t my plan,” he has said. “I liked my life!”</p>
<p>Steve Zakuani, who played alongside Ljungberg for Major League Soccer’s Seattle Sounders, agrees. “If someone had said to me in 2009 or 2010, ‘What’s Freddie going to be doing in a few years?’ I wouldn’t have said ‘coach’. I would have said maybe open a restaurant, or continue modelling.”</p>
<p>A man with interests as diverse as Ljungberg was not an obvious candidate to stay in the game. It’s not something he needed to do either.</p>
<p>“I think football has gone into a new era,” his former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger tells <em>The Athletic</em>. “When players finish their careers now they are rich enough and famous enough, they are not really in need to do any other job. That’s why I’m very proud when they do, because they can carry the values that are important for the club for future generations.”</p>
<p>That’s precisely what Ljungberg is now doing. Arsenal fans who remember the boy with the hairstyle as spiky and colourful as his personality are growing accustomed to the sight of him on the sidelines at training sessions and games: same chiselled features, same steely focus, new sense of purpose.</p>
<p>Ljungberg is embracing his new career as a coach. This is the story of how he has taken the likes of Joe Willock and Bukayo Saka under his wing; how he has steadily made himself an invaluable presence at London Colney — how he’s even learning Spanish to help him communicate better with Unai Emery and his staff.</p>
<p>It’s a considerable turnaround that a player once ambivalent about staying in the game is now being spoken of as a future Arsenal manager.</p>
<p>Ljungberg revealed what led him back to football in an interview with the Sounders’ YouTube channel earlier this year. “When you retire, you dream — or at least I did. ‘Oh, I can do whatever I want, no one can tell me when I have to wake up, I don’t have to run when I don’t want to run…’ All that stuff. You’re dreaming of that for like 20 years. And then when it happens, and you have nothing to do for a year or two, you’re like, ‘What’s the point?’ I can only play so much golf, and I can only sit at home for so long… that’s boring!”</p>
<p>It was then that Ljungberg consulted the man who helped to shape his playing career, Wenger, on what might come next.</p>
<p>“I asked some people from my national team (Sweden) and I asked Arsene, ‘What do you think about me coaching? Do you think it’s just a stupid idea?’ And they were like, ‘No, we think you could be really good at it, so we would like you to do it.’ So I was like, ‘OK. I’ll give it a shot.’”</p>
<p>As Arsenal fans will know better than most, when Ljungberg shoots, he usually scores.</p>
<hr>
<p>When Ljungberg embarked on his coaching badges, the course required him to spend a few days working with young players at a club of his choice. Ljungberg opted for Halmstads Bollklubb, the Swedish team where his career began.</p>
<p>Nicklas Gudmundsson was a team-mate of Ljungberg’s when he first appeared in the first-team dressing room at HBK and remembers a boy who kept quiet except for when he was on the pitch. There, his personality shone.</p>
<p>“He was 17 when he was promoted to the first team, having already been playing with players two or three years older than him in the youth set-up,” recounts Gudmundsson. “He was a bit shy in the dressing room, and sometimes he and his mate were a bit late to training so they got fined, but we saw that he had skills. We saw he had something special and could have a big career.</p>
<p>“When he started to play more regularly we all remember how he played in a famous Cup Winners’ Cup game against Parma (in 1995). He was 18 and turned Hristo Stoichkov. Then he got an elbow from him and stood up to him quite angrily. He was confident in those early days.</p>
<p>“He was an ordinary guy growing up in Halmstad who loved football. Everyone then in that environment was pretty normal. Even if you are special, if you act that way you will not fit in. He didn’t appear like Zlatan Ibrahimovic. You don’t do that in a small city in Sweden.”</p>
<p>Gudmundsson, who is five years older than Ljungberg and moved to the Premier League three seasons before his younger team-mate did, recalls how serious he and his family were about his progression.</p>
<p>“From the early days, he cared about his career,” Gudmundsson recalls. “He was very professional. My father was chairman of the parents’ association of Halmstads Bollklubb and Freddie’s mother had a lot of conversations with him when I left for Blackburn Rovers. They were really interested to find out how it all worked for me. The family was very focused and Freddie was very committed to being a footballer.”</p>
<p>Markus Wephton lives in Halmstad and has been actively supporting both his local team and Arsenal from Scandinavia for decades. He remembers there was something different about a young Ljungberg when he first emerged for the Swedish club. “If I was out on the town I never saw him. I was a similar age as many of the players at that time and we would see some of them in nightclubs and bars and so on. But not Freddie. He had the reputation even then that he was very serious about his game. You could tell that even then.”</p>
<p>Back then he was known for bringing his pillow on the team coach when they travelled to away games. He usually fell asleep before they even reached the highway. He didn’t talk much but was well liked and admired for the way he came into the team with immediate presence and determination.</p>
<p>Ljungberg’s time at Halmstad is commemorated on the wall of fame that adorns the town’s sports arena, a hub for all sporting activity including table tennis, handball and swimming. (Incidentally, Roy Hodgson is there too, fondly remembered for delivering Halmstad’s miraculous first league titles in the 1970s in his first job as a manager).</p>
<p>Ljungberg had been on Arsenal’s radar since he was 16, but had resisted leaving Sweden until he felt he was ready. Arsenal were happy enough with that arrangement, until a starring performance for the national side against England in a 1998 Euros qualifier dramatically raised Ljungberg’s profile.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Arsenal and Wenger were forced to accelerate their interest. They saw off late competition from Chelsea, and Wenger had his man.</p>
<hr>
<p>When Ljungberg arrived, he soon discovered that Wenger had plans for a positional change. He had always been a central playmaker but a shift out to the wing was on the table. At first he was perplexed — and not too keen.</p>
<p>After his first season in London, he met his agent to discuss what to do. He didn’t feel like a winger and mulled over options to move to a club where he would be used as a central midfielder again. His response to this tells a lot about how he has always thought about the game and the strength of his determination to succeed.</p>
<p>As he explains in the book Invincible: “I’d never not made it. I made the decision to come because I like Arsenal, I like Arsene, I like my team-mates. I thought, try and see if I can make it. I changed my attitude that summer, from complaining to trying to learn. As a 21-year-old I had to learn how to become a winger.”</p>
<p>The rest — the ghosting runs from wide positions, the goals, the assists, the battling, the trophies, the unbeaten season — is an integral part of a famous era of Arsenal history.</p>
<p>Ljungberg is remembered by those at the club as intellectually inquisitive, open-minded and fearlessly non-conformist — the parallels with Hector Bellerin, Arsenal’s current embodiment of football modernity, are obvious.</p>
<p>He certainly had his idiosyncrasies. A former Arsenal staff member recalls: “In around 2000-2001, he called a member of staff at midnight. The guy was in bed asleep when the phone rang and the name ‘Ljungberg’ came up, so he thought, ‘Better answer it.’ Without even saying ‘Hello’, Freddie said, ‘I’m in central London. Can I park on a single yellow line?’ The staff member replied, ‘It’s midnight, man!’ He wasn’t a drinker particularly, so he wasn’t drunk, but it showed his social filters were a little bit different.”</p>

<p>Abstinence from alcohol formed part of Ljungberg’s meticulous approach to his career. He may have looked like a free spirit, but behind the scenes there was a fairly strict routine.</p>
<p>He would want the same slot every night on the physio or massage bed — even shifting his appointment by 20 minutes would irritate him. He interrogated the medical staff about the contents and purpose of every pill they advised him to take. An allergy to cheese (it gives him migraines) meant he would examine the menu closely at any hotel Arsenal visited.</p>
<p>Even his life outside of training had a regimented feel. He lived in Hampstead, north London, and would repeatedly visit the same Italian restaurant for a late-night meal. Keen to avoid being spotted, he’d eat in its kitchen with the chefs.</p>
<p>Perhaps those traits — the attention to detail, the rigidity of his diary — were among the first subtle signs that Ljungberg might be a coach in the making.</p>
<p>His Arsenal team-mate Lee Dixon has not been surprised by this evolution into the world of coaching. “I always thought a big part of Freddie’s game as a player was his brain and his ability to pick the right options,” he said. “When you play like he did, you have got to be intelligent. You have got to know the game, know what defenders are thinking.</p>
<p>“He was not reacting on instinct. He could work out where the gaps were going to be and the timing of the run needed. If you were that kind of footballer it would certainly suggest you have the tools to move into the coaching side.</p>
<p>“His image off the pitch might lead you into thinking he is off the cuff and has flamboyance, but his game was more intellectual than that. You don’t time your runs as well as he did by just running. His football intelligence will hold him in good stead in a coaching capacity.</p>
<p>“He can see the pictures. For the intellectual footballers — and I put Freddie in that bracket — the ability to work out spaces as the game is going on can aid someone going into coaching. It doesn’t surprise me he has gone down that path.”</p>
<p>That famed winning mentality is an interesting transferable skill.</p>
<p>“How useful that steely determination is in coaching is hard to quantify,” says Dixon. “When you are a player and you are driven, you are dealing with yourself. But when you are a coach dealing with 20 players in a squad, you have to be adaptable. They won’t all have the same characteristics as you. When you think of someone like Roy Keane, who was so strong-willed, as a coach, when players didn’t come up to his own expectations it could impact on decisions. The really strong-willed coaches have to be flexible with modern players.”</p>
<p>Wenger always spoke vehemently about Ljungberg’s winning mentality. “He was an unbelievable fighter,” the Frenchman said. “He could find resources even when he was dead because of his fighting spirit.”</p>
<p>That battling quality made Ljungberg a legend at Highbury. The relationship was reciprocal: he fell in love with London, and it’s no great surprise to those who know him that he’s now settled there. But in between, there was Germany.</p>
<hr>
<p>When Andries Jonker was unveiled as Wolfsburg manager in February 2017, the Dutchman also took the opportunity to introduce his assistants. Oliver Mutschler was to retain his post as fitness coach, while Jonker’s former colleague at Bayern Munich, Uwe Speidel, was to arrive as an assistant coach. So far, so predictable. However, Jonker wasn’t done.</p>
<p>“The other name will mean more to you,” he told the assembled media. “Freddie Ljungberg is coming.”</p>
<p>Eighteen months beforehand, it was Ljungberg who had picked up the phone to call Jonker. According to the Dutchman, the proposition was straightforward. “I want to begin a coaching career,” Ljungberg had said. “Can you help me?”</p>
<p>Jonker, then Arsenal’s academy manager, responded by granting Ljungberg a placement with their under-16s. According to Jonker, Ljungberg “followed every under-16 training session and match, highly motivated… I have since found out that he is really interested in the individual development of players”.</p>
<p>Ljungberg impressed enough to earn a full-time role coaching the under-15s, and assisting with the under-19s. His methods were well received: one of the warm-ups the players most enjoyed was effectively teaching them how to play out from the back, without them even realising it. When the Bundesliga called for Jonker, he in turn called for Ljungberg to join him.</p>
<p>Wolfsburg is an ideal place for a coach hoping to keep a low profile as he learns his trade. Ljungberg had never particularly relished the spotlight afforded him by his footballing ability. The haircuts, the idiosyncratic fashion sense — these were an expression of his individualism, not a play for the limelight.</p>
<p>“My parents did always tell me: ‘Don’t be a sheep’,” Ljungberg has explained. “’Don’t just do what everybody else does, and think “That’s that.” Make your own choices, and we will stand by you.’ When I wanted to go left when everyone else went right, that was OK. So I just did it.”</p>
<p>When he moved to MLS with Seattle in 2009, he cited the opportunity to escape the constant media attention he had endured in London. In Wolfsburg, he found yet more respite: a town so charmingly humdrum that there’s a running gag about the high-speed train between Hannover and Berlin forgetting to stop there as it passes through.</p>
<p>Wolfsburg’s prosaic nature is well illustrated through the tale of another former Arsenal player, Nicklas Bendtner. He joined the club on a permanent basis in 2016, and a few months after his arrival he agreed to an interview with German publication 11 Freunde. Upon meeting the journalists at the VFL Centre, Wolfsburg’s stadium complex, the Danish striker asked how they’d travelled there. The journalists explained that they had arrived by rail to the city’s Hauptbahnhof station and walked for 20 minutes past shopping centres and car parks. “Ah,” sighed Bendtner. “So you’ve seen everything.”</p>
<p>For Ljungberg, Wolfsburg was an opportunity to focus on his craft and gain invaluable experience working with senior players. In truth, he didn’t really have time to get bored of the place: Jonker’s tenure was beset with problems, and lasted just 19 games.</p>
<p>With Jonker gone, Ljungberg was also released. He was linked with another return to Halmstads, but chose to bide his time.</p>
<p>Back in London, his apprenticeship almost served, he sensed another homecoming was inevitable. And he was right.</p>
<hr>
<p>In June 2018, one of Per Mertesacker’s first actions as the new academy manager was to appoint Ljungberg to oversee Arsenal’s under-23 team. This was a chance to take charge of the second string, this time at London Colney alongside the first team rather than at the academy site 20 miles away at Hale End.</p>
<p>It’s a responsibility that Ljungberg took seriously. He was not strictly required to do media interviews in his new role, for example, but felt it was an important part of his development as a coach.</p>
<p>Even in an academy set-up, his winning mentality came to the fore. The under-23s are principally there to serve the first team, but Ljungberg was not afraid to engage in a tug-of-war when his best players were cherry-picked for first-team training. This was his team and these were his players, and he was determined to build momentum and get results.</p>

<p>Julio Pleguezuelo was Ljungberg’s captain with the under-23s. He said: “Freddie changed the team’s style a bit. With Freddie, we played more ‘man’ football, more realistic football. We knew sometimes we could not play out from the back, so why take a risk? He was trying to adapt us to men’s football. Sometimes we would play more long balls, more counter-attacking. It was a good combination.”</p>
<p>Cohen Bramall worked with Ljungberg throughout his time in charge of the under-23s, and is unequivocal about his quality as a coach. “I’ve worked with Arsene Wenger, I’ve worked with Unai Emery”, the full-back told <em>The Athletic</em>. “I’ve worked with big coaches and, for me, Arsene and Freddie are the best ones that I’ve had.”</p>
<p>It’s Ljungberg’s attention to detail that stands out. When he worked with the under-15s and under-16s, he spent hours on the training ground honing individual skills. He is as interested in technical development as the tactical side of the game, and he carried that through to his coaching at under-23 level.</p>
<p>“He worked with me a lot on my body shape, my first touch,” Bramall explains. “Going forward, he wanted me to shoot more. He would take the time to show me techniques: how to shoot properly using the outside of your foot, for example. With crosses, he showed me you don’t always have to whip it. How to pick someone out. It was always constructive criticism.”</p>
<p>Freddie shared Mertesacker’s vision of a team that would play in “The Arsenal Way”. “Your pass had to be precise,” confirms Bramall. “You know how Arsenal play, but with Freddie everything had to be perfect. You know: finding the pocket on the half-turn, and playing high, rotating at the right time. When the players got that, it worked perfectly. In my opinion we couldn’t be stopped when we got the plan right.”</p>
<p>He wasn’t afraid to exert discipline when required, either. Pleguezuelo noticed Ljungberg was different after his time at Wolfsburg. “The time in Germany changed his mentality to make him a bit more harsh,” he said. “He was very open but at the same time very strict on the football field. It was a very good combination. We knew we had to work very hard for him. Outside the pitch, he wanted us to respect all the staff, all the team-mates, the environment. And from there, it went to the field.”</p>
<p>His man-management impressed too. When Pleguezuelo was called up to first team for a Carabao Cup game against Blackpool last October, it was Ljungberg who broke the news. “On the Tuesday night, Freddie called me, and he said, ‘Listen Julio, I spoke with Unai. He asked me if you were good to play.’ He said he told him that I was ready to play. I really appreciated the call — they were going to tell me the next morning anyway, but Freddie went out of his way and told me the night before. It was satisfying to see that he cared about his players.”</p>
<p>Equally, when Bramall was released by Arsenal at the end of last season, Ljungberg took it upon himself to offer advice and support. The Swede’s iconic status as a player didn’t stop him forming bonds with players half his age. Bramall cites his mentoring of Bukayo Saka as an example: “If you look at Bukayo, he’s in the first team now, and that began with Freddie. He was the one who’d go over every game with him, watch the clips, look at what he did right and wrong.”</p>
<p>The portrait Bramall paints is that of a coach who is hungry to learn, and hungry to teach. He’s thrown himself into his new career. Ljungberg himself has admitted that 11-hour days are not uncommon.</p>
<p>“Freddie was passionate,” Bramall says. “He’s young and he’s been doing something else for a bit. It was the same football as Arsene — the same mentality — but on the sidelines Freddie was more aggressive and a bit more ‘heart on his sleeve’.”</p>
<p>It’s some pitch. “I think Freddie’s got the whole package,” concludes Bramall, now at Colchester United. “I think he’ll be massive at Arsenal in the years to come.”</p>

<p>The “job swap” between Ljungberg and Steve Bould this summer was a move that suited all parties — and indeed was driven by the two coaches.</p>
<p>Bould had been retained as one of Emery’s assistants after Wenger left the club but had become increasingly marginalised in first-team training. Ljungberg’s naturally more abrasive approach made him more suited to challenging a head coach than overseeing a reserves side. So Bould moved over to manage the under-23s, and Ljungberg was installed on Emery’s staff. Bould, Ljungberg and loan manager Ben Knapper now comprise Arsenal’s “transition team” — the staff given the task of helping integrate academy players into the senior squad.</p>
<p>Since the switch, Ljungberg has taken a personal step to aid his own integration into the first-team staff by learning Spanish. There are a number of Spanish speakers in the coaching group as well as Emery, so pushing himself to have the best possible understanding of all the nuances of conversations sums up how Ljungberg is trying to make the best of this opportunity.</p>
<p>The relationship between Emery and Ljungberg has been a positive one. Staff at London Colney cite Emery’s willingness to afford his coaches freedom as one of his strengths.</p>
<p>Ljungberg is also steadily carving out a role for himself within the coaching group. If a player wants to do some extra shooting or dribbling after training, he will volunteer to lead that session. In the dressing room before games, he will sit down with three or four players individually — usually ones he coached at academy level — and calmly and quietly go through clips on an iPad, reasserting instructions.</p>
<p>Watch Ljungberg in any Arsenal warm-up and you begin to see his influence. Before every game, he engages in very targeted practice drills. At Old Trafford, he was sprinting at players to prepare them for an intense press. Prior to the Bournemouth game, he was working with Granit Xhaka and Matteo Guendouzi on receiving passes on the half-turn. When Saka or Joe Willock are being readied on the sidelines, it is Ljungberg who has an arm round their shoulder. His is often the last voice they hear before they take the field.</p>
<p>There is a temptation for Arsenal fans to anoint Ljungberg as manager-in-waiting. Any underwhelming performance under the current regime seems to strengthen his candidacy in the eyes of the supporters — and the Swede carries himself like someone with the ambition to one day take the top job.</p>
<p>However, former team-mate Dixon believes he will be in no immediate rush for another promotion. “What Freddie will get with Unai is time to bed in — watch a bit without the pressure,” said Dixon. “He won’t be asked to be coaching all day every day, because Unai has enough staff around him.”</p>
<p>Staff at Arsenal insist Ljungberg has the confidence and credibility to challenge those above him when necessary — but in a fashion that is constructive rather than disruptive. He is relishing the opportunity to learn as part of this coaching team. In his youth, he was focused principally on himself, but now he takes a more collective approach.</p>
<p>“I think as a player it’s more of a dog-eat-dog world, just very competitive,” he says. “You always need to be ‘the Man’, but at the same time you have to think about the team. When you’re a coach — at least for me — you really have to take a step back. It’s not about me any more, it’s about the players and about how I can help them become better as players and human beings. That was the main thing for me: to put aside the ego —something you need to have as a player — and focus on helping everyone else.”</p>
<p>However, the simple fact is that when managerial change <em>does</em> come, Ljungberg is the Arsenal coach most likely to survive any cull. His popularity with the players may prove a factor in that but, crucially, he’s also someone who can, as Wenger attested, “carry the values” of the club. Ljungberg is part of the old Arsenal, now helping to shape the new Arsenal. The arrival of former team-mate Edu as technical director will only have strengthened his position.</p>
<p>For now, Ljungberg’s apprenticeship continues apace. “There are always challenges,” he says. “I think the biggest challenge for me is to continue to learn”.</p>
<p>It’s been quite a journey from Calvin Klein underwear to Adidas tracksuit.</p>
<p>Right now, Ljungberg sounds like a man absolutely at home: in London, at Arsenal and on the training ground. Thank goodness he gave it a shot.</p>
